  <!-- Additional Description -->
  <section class="mb-16">
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-taupe max-w-4xl">
      In undergrad, I worked on a research project that leveraged 1000 multilingual transcripts from the Philippines, and this made me realize there was an intersection between languages and quantitive analysis. It was my first foray into data science, computational linguistics, and statistics (even though, looking back at it now, all I did really was manually computing summary statistics), and I've never looked back.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-taupe max-w-4xl mt-4">
      In my current role, I use state-of-the-art to solve complex problems in life sciences and pharmaceuticals spaces. I provide SME support on and lead the development of GenAI solutions for internal and external teams, and train our teams on how to use these tools effectively. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-taupe max-w-4xl mt-4">
      With the current landscape of GenAI and technology as a whole, 'using the right tool for the job' has a different definition almost every week, and a part of my role is to always be able to answer this question. There's never a dull moment.
