To address this, Jata MacCabe, Ananya Apparaju, Mengyuan Qiao and I from the University of British Columbia\u2019s<a class=\"ah mm\" href=\"https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/computational-linguistics\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Master of Data Science \u2014 Computational Linguistics</a> program partnered with<a class=\"ah mm\" href=\"https://allard.ubc.ca/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Allard Law (UBC)</a>,<a class=\"ah mm\" href=\"https://www.law.utoronto.ca/student-life/student-clubs-and-events/legal-hackers\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Legal Hackers Ontario</a>, and<a class=\"ah mm\" href=\"https://futureoflaw.utoronto.ca/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Future of Law Lab (University of Toronto)</a> to explore this issue using state of the art methods in Data Science, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Coupling this with the fact that legal support is not equitably accessible to all, to begin with, the justification for this project is clear.</p><blockquote class=\"nm nn no\"><p class=\"mn mo nl mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"0bc1\"><strong class=\"mp gr\"><em class=\"gq\">Exploring the Impact of Eviction Decisions through Data Analysis</em></strong></p></blockquote><p class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gq mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"1249\">The problem at hand is the difficulty in understanding the exact factors that ultimately contribute to judges\u2019 decisions regarding evicting or preserving the tenancy of individuals in Ontario. With over 44,000 cases to analyze, the project aims to shed light on what factors are most significant to a judge\u2019s decision in eviction cases. This pursuit holds the potential to revolutionize access to justice, not just in Ontario and the domain of housing law, but beyond. By unravelling the complexities of this legal provision, the project could enable lawyers to better advocate for their clients, provide invaluable insights for academics, and bring about positive social change for the thousands of individuals facing the threat of eviction.</p><blockquote class=\"nm nn no\"><p class=\"mn mo nl mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"f789\"><strong class=\"mp gr\"><em class=\"gq\">Unravelling the Enigmatic \u201cAll the Circumstances\u201d</em></strong></p></blockquote><p class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gq mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"7413\">While tackling this complex problem, the project faced the significant challenge of deciphering the meaning behind the vague phrase \u201call the circumstances.\u201d This nebulous term offered no concrete guidance and has perplexed legal professionals and scholars. To demystify this, our team turned to quantitative analytics to try to turn each case into a comparable set of data points, which, with enough recorded factors from each case, would let us compare cases on a more tangible basis and hopefully lead us to answer. Luckily, our partner provided us with 700 annotated case files to give us a starting point.</p><blockquote class=\"nm nn no\"><p class=\"mn mo nl mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"1ebb\"><strong class=\"mp gr\"><em class=\"gq\">Expanding the Boundaries of Legal Analysis</em></strong></p></blockquote><p class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gq mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"0bb7\">Having only approximately 700 rows (i.e. cases) and 50 columns (features of each case) of information \u2014 which may sound like a lot, but next to our grand goal of having the same information recorded on over 44,000 cases, this is only a small portion \u2014 we had to develop a system that could robustly and reliably extract these same pieces of information, on <em class=\"nl\">any</em> case file. In the NLP world, the format of these case files is something called <em class=\"nl\">unstructured text</em>, which means that the case files aren\u2019t bound by any strict formatting or pattern \u2014 think of an article like this one \u2014 it can have as many words as the author wants, with as many paragraphs, headers, and more. <em class=\"nl\">Structured text</em>, on the other hand, comes in the exact same format for every single piece of data; think of an Excel spreadsheet with columns and rows \u2014 as mentioned at the beginning of this section. As humans, we are more used to \u2014 and typically prefer consuming unstructured data, but computers and algorithms more easily interpret structured data, as, due to their more consistent format, they can reliably find new data in the same location and format, which means that it can be processed much more quickly than the same data from an unstructured format.</p><p class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gq mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"c09f\">The most central aspect of this project, then, was to develop a system \u2014 or more accurately, many subsystems \u2014 that could each go through a case file of unstructured text, extract a piece of information, and create a structured representation of the extracted information. This structured data can then be passed to a Machine Learning model such as a <a class=\"ah mm\" href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Random Forest Classifier</a> to look at every single extracted piece of information about every single case file, learn the patterns between files and ultimately help us define \u201call the circumstances\u201d, as they each contribute to the outcome of a given case.</p><figure class=\"np nq nr ns nt mf lx ly paragraph-image\"><div class=\"lx ly lz\"><picture><source sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 640px\" srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1280/format:webp/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 1280w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source data-testid=\"og\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 640px\" srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1280/0*K4jDNHV6s0jV-mBB 1280w\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"bi lh mg c\" height=\"359\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"640\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"mh mi mj lx ly mk ml bg b bh ab ee\">Photo credit:<a class=\"ah mm\" href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/sparse-forests-with-fil/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/sparse-forests-with-fil/</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gq mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"1b20\">Undertaking this project has not only served as an opportunity to unearth crucial insights into eviction decisions but has also served as a platform for acquiring new skills. The collaboration required a multidisciplinary approach, combining legal expertise with data analysis and technology. As a result, we had the opportunity to further develop and hone proficiencies in areas such as data analysis, programming, and application development. This fusion of legal knowledge with innovative methods not only enriched our skills in these areas but also laid the groundwork for future advancements at the intersection of law and technology.</p><blockquote class=\"nm nn no\"><p class=\"mn mo nl mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"9edb\"><strong class=\"mp gr\"><em class=\"gq\">Differences from Traditional Lab Work</em></strong></p></blockquote><p class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gq mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"abc2\">This collaboration diverges significantly from traditional lab work commonly undertaken in academic settings. Unlike controlled environments where experiments are conducted, this project involved grappling with real-world legal complexities and analyzing thousands of real cases. The scale and complexity of the data necessitated novel approaches and methodologies, pushing the boundaries of conventional legal analysis, especially in the domain of Housing Law. Many other areas of law such as Tax Law have been explored in more detail, and are sometimes more easily explorable from a quantitative lens due to the structure of the domain\u2019s laws. If a particular legal domain has clearly defined criteria and conditions, it stands to reason that the specific factor(s) of a decision in the domain should be easier to uncover. In the domain of Housing Law, where the particular factors leading to a judge\u2019s decision tend to be more clouded, this research is less prefaced and therefore all the more necessary.</p><blockquote class=\"nm nn no\"><p class=\"mn mo nl mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"cd16\"><strong class=\"mp gr\"><em class=\"gq\">A Path to Justice &amp; Understanding</em></strong></p></blockquote><p class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gq mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk gj bl\" id=\"80f9\">Though the project has not been completed with our work in the time we had, we are thrilled to have been able to spearhead this project to bring justice and understanding to eviction decisions. Through the transformative power of Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, our project has aimed to reduce barriers to legal support, empower all parties to understand their own circumstances more effectively, provide vital insights for academics, and bring about positive social change for those facing the daunting threat of eviction. We faced numerous challenges, but our dedication and novel approaches have begun the journey to redefining the boundaries of legal analysis. By bridging the gap between law and technology, we not only acquired new skills but paved the way for future advancements in this fascinating intersection. This collaborative endeavour represents a significant step toward a more just and transparent legal system, where access to justice is more equitable for all.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></article>"}
